Codes for: 

- 1 Evaluate temporal trends of Pygoscelis penguin breeding success in the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula; 

- 2 Evaluate temporal variability of krill biomass in relation to fishing harvest; 

- 3  compare penguin breeding success in periods of low or high krill biomass and low or high fishing catches. 

Four data sources were used: [MAPPPD data](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0032247417000055) [@Humphries2017].  File named `MAPPPD.Rds`; CCAMLR acoustic estimates of krill biomass `CCAMLR_krill_biomass.Rds`, summarized fishing catch `CCAMLR_krill_fishing_catch.Rds` and management strata shapefiles `AMLR_Strata.Rds`. Refer to the manuscript for methodological details.
